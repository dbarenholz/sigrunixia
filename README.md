- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sigrunixia, also known as Rebbecca Bishop.
- 👀 **Curiosity**: I’m fascinated by 🐲, 📚, [@Obsidianmd](https://github.com/obsidianmd), and let's be honest, everything.
- 🌱 **Learning**: Typescript and SASS.
- 💞️ **Giving Back**: I’m looking to collaborate on TTRPG Design, Worldbuilding, and Community Outreach, in easy to use formats like Markdown and for little-to-no cost.
- 🎓 **Education**:I recently finished up my Bachelor's level education, and graduated with honors. I worked full-time for most of it.
- 💻 **Career**: I am a Customer Support Specialist at @Obsidianmd](https://github.com/obsidianmd). I douse fires, I write documentation, and I am all around the one who gets the customer admin work done. 
- 🫶 **Whats next**? Getting better at studying and consolidating knowledge into something past a generalist stage.
